1)Data Inspection & Cleaning

  -Created a Jupyter Notebook to explore and validate the datasets.
  -Identified inconsistencies (e.g. unit mismatches) and updated the data accordingly based on project type (generation, storage, grid, etc.).

2)Dataset Preparation

  -Saved the cleaned and updated datasets as .csv files.
  -Uploaded the datasets into Retool for further visualization.

3)Retool App Development

  -Built two Retool pages:
    -Projects Page: Displays a searchable and filterable table of energy projects.
    -Publications Page: Displays a searchable and filterable table of publications.

4)Interactive Drawer for Details
