##Data Inspection & Cleaning

Created a Jupyter Notebook to explore and validate the datasets.

Identified inconsistencies (e.g. unit mismatches) and updated the data accordingly based on project type (generation, storage, grid, etc.).

##Dataset Preparation

Saved the cleaned and updated datasets as .csv files.

Uploaded the datasets into Retool for further visualization.

##Retool App Development

Built two Retool pages:

Projects Page: Displays a searchable and filterable table of energy projects.

Publications Page: Displays a searchable and filterable table of publications.

Interactive Drawer for Details

Implemented row click events for both tables.

When a row is clicked, a Drawer component expands to show additional details of the selected project or publication.

âœ¨ Features
âœ… Search and filter functionality on both tables.

âœ… Dynamic drawer showing full row details.

âœ… Easy CSV data integration into Retool.

âœ… Clean separation of views for projects and publications.
